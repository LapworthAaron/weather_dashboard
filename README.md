<br>
The task was to create a weather dashboard using the openweather api. The site is to allows a user to search any town/city and save it in a search history. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
Some of the acceptance criteria for this project:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
* When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
* When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
* When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
